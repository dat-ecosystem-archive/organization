# Call Facilitation

Here's a guide for facilitating Consortium calls.

This is a rough description of what Mauve has been doing thus far, and probably has a lot of room for 
improvement.

## Mock Agenda
- Share the notes and ask for help/assistance 
- Catch up / Personal Updates / Announcements
  - Icebreaker question! 
- Foundation Discussion
  - CS&S Report by Jess or Joe
  - Event organization
  - Funding strategies
  - New conspirators (does anyone want to invite someone to the next meeting? who are they?) 
- Technical Discussion
  - DEPs
  - hyper*
  - UX (cli, desktop, docs) 
- Wrap up (last ~10/5 min)
  - Next meeting: Any suggested changes? 
  - Who will do facilitation?
  - Upcoming birthdays

---

## Before the meeting

- Send an email on the Monday of the week the call is on or update the description of the calendar event.
- Create a new HackMD file for the meeting notes and share
- Send an email an hour or two before the meeting, include link to the HackMD
- Get in the meeting room 5-10 mins early to wait for people to show up

## During the meeting

- Start recording the zoom meeting to the cloud before starting to actually talk about stuff
- Repost the HackMD link a few times as people are joining in the room
- Start with introductions.
- Use the "raise hand" feature of Zoom for when people want to speak
- Try to prioritize based on who raised their hand first, or those that haven't had a chance to talk
- Go through the agenda items and ask if more items should be added, or if any should be tabled for later
- Go through agenda items one at a time.
- Sometimes it's good to go through each person on the call and ask them if they want to comment about the 
agenda item. This can be frustrating for those that are comfortable with voicing their opinions, but it can help 
for those that would otherwise not get a chance to speak.
- Sometimes it's good to ask the room if anyone has something to add. Give a pause of a good few seconds while 
people decide if they want to add something. Do this at the end of every agenda item / meeting
- Try to keep track of potential agenda items that you hear in the notes

## At the end of the meeting

- Review agenda items that might have been proposed.
- Ask people to propose agenda items or +1 existing ones
- Record the agreed upon agenda items in the notes
- Confirm availability for the next meeting
- Thank everyone for coming and hand off the meeting to Mathias and Paul
- Find someone else to facilitate next meeting

## After the meeting

- Download the reocrded zoom call and listen to it at 1.5x speed and transcribe the conversations into the hackmd
- Try to do this before Friday
- Send out a follow up email with the updated notes, a brief summary of interesting things, and the date of the 
next meeting
