# Dat MOSS Report 2

Report to Mozilla on Milestones 1 + 2:

### Community Experience Research (3 weeks)

* This milestone was achieved through an online survey, a Dat meetup tangential to Data Tera Nemo (DTN) conference, discussions with key Dat contributors in Berlin prior to DTN, and informal interviews of people new to Dat at Dat Night events. 
* Through this process, we learned how entry into the Dat ecosystem is difficult for people with varying goals. Because the work of identifying and organizing with existing community members took more time than expected, we were not able to do a full research process of “conditions for community growth” as outlined in the Statement of Work. 
* As a result of this work, we refocused (and rebranded) our core community efforts from “Dat Project” to “Dat Protocol Foundation” to highlight the goal of empowering a consortium of projects to build on a common foundation as discussed in this blog post. The consortium has now had five meetings.


### Dat.Land Community Prototype (4 weeks)

* We launched an early prototype of this website last fall, before doing the Community Experience Research. Based on the feedback from the community research process, we created a new website structure to fully encompass all of the touch points Dat community members interacted and learned about Dat.
* While this process was really helpful, it also became a bit overwhelming as it required a complete website overhaul and consolidating several different websites and content structures into one. As a result, it took much longer than expected and involved many hours of volunteer work not covered under this MOSS award.
* The new website has launched with the help of the community. The website includes a CMS, allowing easier contributions and content development for various skill types. Our docs include a new tutorial and we will continue to expand those. While we did not get as far as hoped with the MOSS award, we feel it has allowed us to create a solid foundation for continued improvements and community contributions.
