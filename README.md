# Dat Project Organizational Administration

*Dat Project aims to be transparent about funding and the process of fundraising. We believe digital tools we rely on for community organization & communication should be transparently funded and operated. This repository contains information about Dat Project funding and other organizational administration.*

*For details on Dat project governance, see [this repository](https://github.com/datproject/governance).*

* Dat Project started in **[June 2013](https://github.com/datproject/dat/tree/464679267049899eafa345125a0f2212f91be456)** and has been funded mostly by grants by US-based private foundations.
* Dat has received **$1.58 million in grants** as of October 2018, which account for the majority of revenue. Additionally, Dat has received approximately $75k in private donations.
* Dat has been supported by groups including: Knight Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Moore Foundation, and Mozilla.
* [Code for Science & Society](http://codeforscience.org/), a US nonprofit, was founded in September 2016 to support the Dat Project.

## Financial Information

As we continue to improve our transparency around operations, we hope to post new and existing grant applications, awards, and other related documents when applicable. We also hope to provide insight into the grant funding process. For other examples of financial transparency, see [this repository](https://github.com/joehand/open-source-finances).
