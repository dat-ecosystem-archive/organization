# Dat Project Organizational Administration

*Dat Project aims to be transparent about funding and the process of fundraising. We believe digital tools we rely on for community organization & communication should be transparently funded and operated. This repository contains information about Dat Project funding and other organizational administration.*

*For details on Dat project governance, see [this repository](https://github.com/datproject/governance).*

* Dat Project started in **[June 2013](https://github.com/datproject/dat/tree/464679267049899eafa345125a0f2212f91be456)** and has been funded mostly by grants by US-based private foundations.
* Dat has received over **$1.75 million in grants**, which account for the majority of revenue. Additionally, Dat has received approximately $75k in private donations.
* Dat has been supported by groups including: Knight Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Moore Foundation, and Mozilla.
* [Code for Science & Society](http://codeforscience.org/), a US nonprofit, was founded in September 2016 to support the Dat Project.

We also hope to provide insight into the grant funding process. For other examples of financial transparency, see [this repository](https://github.com/joehand/open-source-finances).
